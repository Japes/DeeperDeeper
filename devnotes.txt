free diving :)

-------------------------------

make it paused until you kick

use local storage to save last entered name

basic sound
    the sound actually might be better as 8bit?
    heartbeat

MOBILE FRIENDLY
    resolution issues?
    tap controls
    enter name :/

some kind of interesting change as you go deep
    different fish? or something
    rope with measurements (start at 2m down, or something)

more eye candy
    make depth tint a tint on a texture, so there is a gradient towards the bottom
    rays of light from the surface
    bubbles when you kick...
    big flashing indication when you reach every 10m? or something

MainMenu
    opening screen w/instructions

protect sql entries
    looks like there is a fundamental weakness with server-side code using apis...
    could at least obfuscate
    could encrypt and send like i do with unit, will still be able to find the encryption key in the source but at least you cant just copy/paste the url

heartbeat (proportional to o2 usage)

3 round format

kick/turn tappable buttons?

turn around animation

create an animated favicon? https://www.favicon.cc/

pre-dive breathing minigame
side minigame for mental state?

a lot of the stuff can be extracted into utils 
find a less hacky way of ensuring that the score has persisted to the db
