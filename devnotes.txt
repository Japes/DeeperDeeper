free diving :)

-------------------------------

basic sound
    water ambience?
    heartbeat
    
stuff gets darker as you go deeper
    make this a tint on a texture, so there is a gradient towards the bottom


MainMenu
    opening screen w/instructions

protect sql entries
    looks like there is a fundamental weakness with server-side code using apis...
    could at least obfuscate
    could encrypt and send like i do with unit, will still be able to find the encryption key in the source but at least you cant just copy/paste the url

bubbles when you kick...

rope with measurements (start at 2m down, or something)

tunnel vision
visibility getting worse as you get deep
    perhaps need flashes of visibility
heartbeat (proportional to o2 usage)

MOBILE FRIENDLY
    resolution issues?
    tap controls
    enter name :/

3 round format

kick/turn tappable buttons?

turn around animation

create an animated favicon? https://www.favicon.cc/

pre-dive breathing minigame
side minigame for mental state?


a lot of the stuff can be extracted into utils 
find a less hacky way of ensuring that the score has persisted to the db
